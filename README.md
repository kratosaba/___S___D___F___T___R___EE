# S D F T R E E

This repository contains the code for the project "S D F T R E E", which focuses on developing a complicated algorithm to reconstruct 3D objects using slices of a target object through the utilization of Neural Networks. The algorithm employs a tree data structure constructed from Neural Networks to combine them and create a 3D function representation.


## File Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `main.py`: The main script to execute the algorithm and generate the reconstructed 3D objects using the tree data structure and Neural Networks.
- `preprocessing.py`: Contains functions for preprocessing the input data and preparing it for the neural network.
- `network.py`: Implements the architecture of the neural network used for the reconstruction task.
- `tree.py`: Defines the tree data structure and its operations for combining the Neural Networks.
- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for data loading, saving results, and visualization.
- `data/`: Directory containing the input data slices for the reconstruction process.
- `results/`: Directory where the reconstructed 3D objects will be saved.
